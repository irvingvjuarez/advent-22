# Advent 22

Although it has its roots in Catholicism, Advent has become a tradition where children got chocolate for 4 weeks, one per day, from 1 to 24 December. Here we adapt it to programming challenges.

In this case, [@midudev](https://twitter.com/midudev) has decided to create the advent.js 2022 version.
